Welcome to the main page of the Sepica Image Container project.

This project aims to create an app that can be used to encrypt images and store them in an 
image container in a computer environment. It will help you organize your images and
encrypt them to protect them from unauthorized access.

As of July 19, 2025, this project is a work in progress.
