Also, one of the features is a backend for encrypting and decrypting images. The CLI will be 
implemented in Python using the argparse library. The CLI will be used to encrypt and 
decrypt images.

The CLI will have a container where the images will be stored. The CLI will have a button
to encrypt the images. The CLI will have a button to decrypt the images. The container, or storage
will act like as a compressed file or a folder that can only be accessed through password protected
GUI.

CLI also will have a function to delete the images from the container. This will me implemented with 
Python using the os library. The images will be deleted indefinitely from the container, even backup
programs will not be able to access the images. The deleted images will be deleted from the user's 
computer.

The CLI will have a function to download the images to the user's computer. This will be implemented
with Python using the shutil library. The images will be downloaded to the user's computer. The images
will be downloaded indefinitely, even backup programs will not be able to access the images. The images
will be downloaded to the user's computer.

The CLI will have a function to upload the images to the container. This will be implemented with
Python using the shutil library. The images will be uploaded to the container. The images will be
uploaded until they are deleted, even backup programs will not be able to access the images. 
The images will be uploaded to the container.

All of these functions will be visible to the user through the GUI.
