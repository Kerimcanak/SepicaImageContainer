Lets make a Python project. 
in this Python project there will be a GUI,
the program only can be opened through a password, which will set by the user in the first opening and can later be changed after program has opened in the File... -> Passwords section
in the GUI there will be things such as: title bar (minimize, close, name of app (Sepica Image Container), logo), 
the container in middle with title "Images", 
container will store the images by either through the upload button on the bottom or the drag and drop, 
image will be encrypted immediately as it had been placed inside the tray, 
the container will act like a zip folder or a cloud storage, when clicked user can display the images through the program
when selected user will have two choices, one: open the image two: delete the image. The buttons on the bottom will decide this.
when file is deleted the file will be indefinitely deleted as there will be no way to access it through any recovery programs
there will be also third "download..." option, which will allow user to download
